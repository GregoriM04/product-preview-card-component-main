## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge, I was able to reinforce many concepts and learn a few more properties, and also certain behaviors of other ones.

I have here a property I wish I knew when I started:

```css
.item-img .desktop-img {
    filter:saturate(103%) contrast(115%) brightness(86%);
}
```

I wish I knew that when I started because sometimes I had a specific image on my mind, so I used to use Photoshop to make images darker or to get a little bit of extra saturation. But now I know I can get the image the way I want just coding a little bit :)

### Continued development

I just need to keep myself practicing, even if It's just one or two hours per week. With consistency and time, I'll get it.

### Useful resources

- [Geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-darken-an-image-using-css/) - This helped me to understand the best way to manipulate an image with CSS.
